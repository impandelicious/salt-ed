Our solution is a “key in hand” add-on comprised of three compartments holding water, sand, and salt. Two motors on the lower level controls the slide gates to reach a specific flow so does the actuated ball valve. The estimated price for one prototype is around 600$, and currently, there are no other similar products available that can offer you this application.

We aim to launch a partner app that has data logging enabled, with each sensor tracked by the system, and its information stored via a cloud server. This is not only helpful for cities and business owners to monitor contractors, but also serves as useful information for insurance purposes as it can be used as evidence should a slip-and-fall accident occur.
